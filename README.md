# Unchained

Unchained is a mobile application that enables residents to find unique experiences within their city by connecting them with small businesses. Users can select their interests, and then stores offering timed coupons will be indicated on their map.

The app serves to make it easier for small business to acquire customers and get noticed within a city, such as New York, where are even hundreds of establishments packed into a square mile.

This is a web app that serves as a _prototype_ of the mobile app.

This prototype was created at the Mastercard Master's of Code NYC hackathon, and uses the following APIs:

* Mastercard Places API
* Mastercard Simplify Commerce's Hosted Payments
* Google Maps API
